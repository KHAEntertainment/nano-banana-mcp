## ‚≠ê Terminal Banner with ASCII-to-Photorealistic Transition

**File:** `terminal-banner.png`  
**Tool:** `generate_image`  
**Prompt:**
```
A terminal window interface with black background and bright yellow text that says "NANO BANANA" at the top. Below it, centered, is an ASCII art banana made of text characters. The fascinating part: halfway down the image, the ASCII banana gradually transforms and transitions into a photorealistic, actual yellow banana - as if it's coming to life and materializing from the digital text into reality. The transformation should be seamless and magical, showing the evolution from simple text art to a beautiful, real banana. Terminal-style monospace font, retro computing aesthetic, dramatic lighting on the realistic banana portion.
